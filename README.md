# geofencing-gsmgps
This project was done as a practicum assignment. This code essentially sets up a system to monitor the location of a device (helps to track). It checks if the object moves outside a defined area (geofence) and, if so, it activates an alarm and sends an SMS to a specified phone number with the object's current location. The main devices used were arduino uno, gps, and gsm.
